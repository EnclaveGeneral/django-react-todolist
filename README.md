# django-react-todolist

To give everyone some practice working with Django and React, as well as git, we would like you to complete the following steps. This will involve completing the tutorial linked below to create a to-do list as well as pushing your code to GitHub to prove that you have completed the exercise. Feel free to ask questions, particularly if you haven't used git before!

1. Clone this repository
2. Create and checkout a branch named <code>FirstName-LastName</code> (e.g. Anna-Wang)
3. Complete [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react)
4. Stage and commit your changes
5. Push your branch to the remote repository

Note: the <code>backend/settings.py</code> file contains a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> that we don't want to expose when we push our code to GitHub. To avoid this, follow the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31883505/how-to-i-hide-my-secret-key-using-virtualenv-and-django) to add it to a <code>.gitignore</code> file.
